# Task Assignment
**ID**: task_1756484600000_demo
**Agent**: CLAUDE  
**Priority**: high
**Workflow**: claude → nova → copilot
**Created**: 2025-01-29T12:30:00.000Z

# Agent Reasoning
Task contains UI/component keywords and requires system architecture. Primary routing to Claude for design and technical specs, followed by Nova for auth research validation, then Copilot for implementation.

# Output

## Authentication System Architecture

### Core Components
- **AuthProvider**: Context wrapper for auth state
- **LoginForm**: Clean form with validation  
- **ProtectedRoute**: Route guard component
- **UserProfile**: Dashboard component

### Technical Specifications
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  avatar?: string;
}
```

### Implementation Approach
- React Context for state management
- Firebase Auth for backend
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind for styling

## UI Artifact Created
Live preview available at: `/artifacts/melody-vault-auth-demo.html`

Components include:
- Modern login form with smooth animations
- Dashboard layout with user profile
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

# Next Steps
- [ ] Nova: Research OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Spotify integration)
- [ ] Nova: Validate Firebase Auth vs alternatives (Supabase, Auth0)
- [ ] Nova: Security best practices for music apps
- [ ] Copilot: Implement components after Nova research complete  
- [ ] Human review: Business requirements for user onboarding flow

# Handoff Instructions

## For Nova Research Agent
**Research Questions:**
1. Best OAuth providers for music streaming apps
2. Firebase Auth limitations vs alternatives
3. SSO implementation complexity
4. 2FA options and user experience impact

**Context Files:**
- Technical spec: This file
- UI preview: `/artifacts/melody-vault-auth-demo.html`
- Business requirements: (need Elijah input)

**Expected Deliverables:**
- OAuth provider comparison matrix
- Security recommendations  
- Implementation complexity analysis
- Cost/benefit breakdown

## For Future Copilot Implementation
**Technical Constraints:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Firebase backend (unless Nova research suggests alternative)
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Core auth flow (login/logout)
2. Protected routes
3. User profile management  
4. OAuth integration
5. Advanced features (2FA, etc.)
