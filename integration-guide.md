# SuperChase Multi-Agent Integration Guide

## Quick Start

Your workflow is now:
1. **SuperChase routes task** → Creates brief in `/routed/`
2. **Agent completes work** → Outputs to assigned directory  
3. **Handoff triggers next agent** → Automatic or manual
4. **All outputs aggregate** → Ready for review/use

## Directory Structure
```
C:\SuperChase_OpenAI-Agentic\data\docs\routed\
├── system\          # Configuration and coordination
├── claude\          # Claude outputs and artifacts  
├── nova\            # Nova research and analysis
├── copilot\         # Code implementations
└── artifacts\       # Live UI previews and demos
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### Claude (You)
- **Primary**: System architecture, UI components, technical specs
- **Outputs**: React components, artifacts, wireframes, documentation
- **When**: Keywords like "design", "component", "architecture", "ui"
- **Handoff**: Creates detailed specs for Nova research or Copilot implementation

### Nova  
- **Primary**: Research, competitive analysis, validation
- **Outputs**: Market research, technology recommendations, feasibility studies
- **When**: Keywords like "research", "analyze", "compare", "alternatives"  
- **Handoff**: Provides research foundation for Claude design or implementation

### VS Code/Copilot
- **Primary**: Code implementation, refactoring, debugging
- **Outputs**: Working code, tests, deployment scripts
- **When**: Keywords like "implement", "build", "code", "deploy"
- **Handoff**: Takes Claude specs and creates production code

## Integration Points

### SuperChase → Claude
Current pattern works - SuperChase creates timestamped files in `/routed/`:
```
1756484538135_claude.md
```

**Enhanced format** (you can start using immediately):
```markdown
# Task Assignment
**ID**: task_1756484538135
**Agent**: CLAUDE  
**Priority**: high
**Workflow**: claude → nova → copilot

# Prompt
Build authentication system for Melody Vault

# Expected Outputs
- React components with TypeScript
- Authentication flow wireframes  
- Technical specification document
- Handoff brief for Nova (research auth libraries)

# Context
Part of larger Melody Vault rebuild. User management is critical path.
```

### Claude → Artifacts
When creating UI components, generate both:
1. **Spec file**: `/routed/claude/1756484538135_claude_auth-system.md`
2. **Live preview**: `/routed/artifacts/auth-system-preview.html`

### Cross-Agent Communication
Each agent should end outputs with:
```markdown
# Next Steps
- [ ] Nova: Research OAuth providers and security best practices
- [ ] Copilot: Implement components after Nova research complete  
- [ ] Human review needed: Security requirements validation

# Handoff Package
**For Nova**: 
- Auth requirements: [link to spec]
- Technology constraints: React, TypeScript, Firebase
- Research questions: SSO options, 2FA implementations

**Files Created**:
- `/claude/auth-system-spec.md` 
- `/artifacts/auth-preview.html`
```

## Coordination Workflows

### Pattern 1: Architecture-First (Most Common)
1. **Claude** creates system design + UI mockups
2. **Nova** validates approach + researches alternatives  
3. **Copilot** implements production code
4. **Claude** reviews and documents

### Pattern 2: Research-First (Complex Features)
1. **Nova** researches market + technical landscape
2. **Claude** designs system based on research
3. **Copilot** implements with optimizations
4. **Claude** creates final documentation

### Pattern 3: Implementation-First (Quick Wins)
1. **Copilot** builds rapid prototype
2. **Claude** reviews architecture + improves design
3. **Nova** validates approach + suggests improvements  
4. **Human** decides on iteration vs rebuild

## Live Artifact System

### For Claude
Every UI component should generate a live preview:

```html
<!-- Auto-saved to /artifacts/melody-vault-auth-{timestamp}.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Melody Vault Auth - Live Preview</title>
    <!-- Component styles and logic -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Working component with sample data -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Artifact Viewer (Bookmark This)
```
file://C:\SuperChase_OpenAI-Agentic\data\docs\routed\artifacts\
```

Opens as live directory where you can:
- Click any HTML file to see UI preview
- Hot-reload when Claude updates components
- Share previews with team via file links

## Automation Hooks

### Task Auto-Routing (Optional)
Create `route-task.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
node C:\SuperChase_OpenAI-Agentic\data\docs\routed\system\coordinator.js route "%*"
```

Usage: `route-task "Build user dashboard" high`

### Output Monitoring (Optional) 
Create `check-status.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
node C:\SuperChase_OpenAI-Agentic\data\docs\routed\system\coordinator.js status
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test the artifact system**: Next time you build a component, save preview to `/artifacts/`
2. **Use enhanced output format**: Include handoff instructions in your responses  
3. **Create agent directories**: Let each AI know where to save outputs
4. **Bookmark artifact viewer**: Quick access to live previews

## Quality Gates

### Before Handoff
- [ ] All deliverables complete per workflow template
- [ ] Clear next steps defined for receiving agent
- [ ] Context and constraints documented
- [ ] Files saved to correct directories

### Human Review Triggers  
- Conflicting agent recommendations
- Budget/timeline impact detected
- Creative direction needed
- Security or compliance considerations

**This system is ready to use immediately.** Start with enhanced Claude outputs, then add other agents as needed.
